# Hi, I'm Gung NandaðŸ‘‹ here's,  
## CNN Model Learning 

object detect with python using CNN algorithm with 6 layers activation.

To use this code, download the required libraries. and create a folder cnamed datasets


## folder structure

```bash
  /datasets
      /train
          /class1
          /class2
      /validation
          /class1
          /class2
```

## IMPORTANT NOTE'S
- Be careful with the datasets provided, because it will greatly affect the size of the MODEL'S file. The more Train and Validation files, the larger the size.
- The recommended Train and Validation data is 70:30, namely 70% Train and 30% Validation.
- For Data Validation, quality is above quantity. That means data validation requires quality image data, not just a lot.
- Batch size and epoch variables in the code are largely responsible for the length of model training, Validation Loss and Validation Accuracy.
